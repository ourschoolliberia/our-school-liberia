		h7 ABOUT LIBERIA
		.line Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States. It lies on the West African coastline, nestled between Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Between 1989 and 2003 it suffered a devastating civil war, which saw more than 250,000 killed, tens of thousands internally displaced, and over 300,000 fleeing as refugees. More recently, it has been at the centre of the worst outbreak of Ebola that the world has ever seen.

		h2 THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

		.line The war destroyed every sector of the country, including infrastructure, the economy and the education system. Even now, more than a decade later, illiteracy and unemployment rates remain among the worst in the world. With so many schools destroyed, the education system in Liberia is only just beginning to function again.

		.line During the war, many children were recruited as child soldiers and never saw the inside of a classroom. Instead they were socialized in the context of guns and drugs. Having missed out on an education, they were unable to get jobs, and without jobs, they are now struggling to educate their own children. It is often seen as more viable to send a child to work in the fields or selling at the local market, than to incur the costs of tuition, books and uniforms.
